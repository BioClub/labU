## ProcessWire: Setting up Email 

## ProcessWire: Resetting Passwords
On a production server, resetting via email works.

## ProcessWire: Resetting Passwords (The Hard Way)
On a dev server, email sending is usually not configured, we need to reset the password the _hard_ way. (Well, not really _that_ hard.)
https://processwire.com/talk/topic/1736-forgot-backend-password-how-do-you-reset/

>>> You can always reset your password just by pasting this temporarily into any one of your templates, and then viewing a page that uses the template:

```
$u = $users->get('admin'); // or whatever your username is
$u->of(false);
$u->pass = 'your-new-password';
$u->save();
```

>>> Passwords are in a table called field_password. They are hashed and salted, and not reversible, so no way to set or change them without going directly through the API.

Ok, interesting & secure. In WP it's possible to change a password - if there is access to the DB.
